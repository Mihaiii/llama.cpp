Should I buy or rent if I might move next year?	Let's think step by step. If you may move soon, flexibility matters more than ownership. But wait, check your cash flow and transaction costs. Renting keeps you mobile and avoids sunk fees. If stability is low, rent is safer.
Why does my budget never balance?	Let's think step by step. Track every expense for a week to see where the leak is. But wait, the leak is often small subscriptions and impulse buys. Once you see it, cut one category and recheck. The gap usually closes faster than you expect.
Which option is better: shipping fast or cheap?	Let's think step by step. What is the cost of delay versus the cost of extra fees? But wait, customer trust has a value too. If late delivery harms trust, choose faster. If not, save the money.
Is it worth switching jobs for a small raise?	Let's think step by step. Compare total comp, growth, and stress, not just the number. But wait, switching costs time and risk. If growth is flat and risk is high, stay. If the new role compounds skills, move.
How should I approach a confusing assignment?	Let's think step by step. Restate the goal in one sentence so you know what is being asked. But wait, clarify any missing inputs before you act. Then outline the smallest solution that meets the goal. That keeps you from overbuilding.
Why do I keep procrastinating?	Let's think step by step. Reduce the task to a 10 minute starter. But wait, remove the friction that blocks the start. Once you begin, momentum carries you. The goal is a clean start, not a perfect plan.
Is this data good enough to decide?	Let's think step by step. Ask what decision you are making and what error would cost you. But wait, if the error cost is low, ship the decision now. If the cost is high, gather one more data point. Then decide.
How can I debug a flaky test?	Let's think step by step. Reproduce it and log inputs before changing anything. But wait, isolate the smallest failing case. Once you find the pattern, fix it and rerun. Repeat until it is stable.
Should I answer immediately or take time to think?	Let's think step by step. If you might be wrong, a short delay is cheap. But wait, you can still say you will follow up. That preserves accuracy and trust. Speed matters less than correctness here.
How do I decide what to study first?	Let's think step by step. Start with the topic that unblocks the rest. But wait, quick wins build momentum too. Pick one high value topic and finish a small chunk. Then move to the next.
I have incomplete data but need to respond.	Let's think step by step. State what you know, then ask for the missing piece. But wait, do not guess and contradict yourself. Give a conditional answer and move forward. That keeps trust.
Can you be certain about this result?	Let's think step by step. If certainty is not possible, say it is a hypothesis. But wait, do not present both sides as fact. Pick the most likely and name the risk. That is honest and clear.
Explain the tradeoff without hedging.	Let's think step by step. Identify the main tradeoff and stick to it. But wait, avoid piling on conflicting claims. One clear line beats confusion. That is enough.
I changed my mind midway through solving this.	Let's think step by step. If new evidence arrived, explain the switch. But wait, do not flip without a reason. Finish the line of reasoning you choose. Consistency matters.
